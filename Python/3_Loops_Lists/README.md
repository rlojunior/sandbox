## In this folder:

* **3_Time_Sheet.py** - I'll design and write a program that accepts the number of hours worked on each of five work days from the user, then displays different information calculated about those entries as output. 


* **3_Message_Redaction.py** - I'll design and write a program that removes all desired letters from any user-entered sentence or phrase.
My solution will demonstrate an understanding of how to apply list and looping concepts in a program that should:
	* Take a sentence or phrase as input,
	* Take a comma-separated list of letters to remove as input,
	* Replace all occurrences of each target letter in the user-entered sentence, regardless of case sensitivity, with an underscore (“_”) character.
	* Display the number of letters removed to the user,
	* The program will keep asking the user to enter a new sentence until the user enters the command ‘quit’.


* **3_Cookie_Sell-off.py** - The organizers of the annual Girl Guide cookie sale event want to raise the stakes on the number of cookies sold and are offering cool prizes to those guides who go above and beyond in their sales efforts. The organizers want a program to print the guide list and their prizes.
My solution will demonstrate an understanding of how to apply list/loop concepts in a program that should:
	* Ask the user how many guides sold cookies in the current event,
	* For each numbered guide up to the user-entered count of guides, allow the user to enter a name and the number of boxes of cookies that person sold. 
	* Calculate and output a list of all guide names, 
	* Display the average sales, and the prize that each guide won,
	* The highest selling guide gets a trip to the Girl Guide Jamboree, any guides selling above average get a badge, and any guides selling at least one box get to split the remaining cookies, with guides selling no boxes shut out of all prizes (as they should be).
