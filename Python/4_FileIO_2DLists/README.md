## In this folder:

* **4_The_A_Team.py** - I'll design and write a program that reads the text from a provided text file into a list, displays the text on-screen, makes some alterations to the text and outputs the changed text to the screen, then saves the altered text as a new file. 

* **4_The_Itsy_Bitsy_Aardvark.py** - I'll design and develop a program that presents the user with a “Mad Libs” type game, where a random choice of words are read from a file, then interjected into a story read from another file.
My solution will demonstrate an understanding of how to apply file I/O, string manipulation, list and looping concepts.

* **4_Battleship.py** - I'll design and develop a program that replicates the functionality of the provided sample application, a simple version of the game Battleship.
My solution will demonstrate an understanding of how to apply file I/O, list and looping concepts, in a Battleship program.
