* **2_Landscape_Calculator.py** - A landscaping company needs a program that computes the price of landscaping for a new housing development. Work orders are based on: address, plot length and width in feet, type of grass (“fescue”, “bentgrass” or “campus”), and number of trees. The price is computed as follows:  
	* There is a base labour charge of $1000. 
	* If the surface (length * width) is over 5000 square feet, add $500. 
	* The cost is calculated per square foot. If the grass is “fescue” the cost is $0.05; for “bentgrass” it is $0.02; “campus” is $0.01. 
	* Each tree requested has a $100 charge.


* **2_Mobile_Data_Plans.py** - Erewhon Mobile charges cellular customers a rate based on the total amount of data used by a customer in the billing period.For simplicity, customers are charge based on 
	which range their total data usage falls within. Note, it is not a 
	cumulative charge; my program will figure out which single range the usage falls into, then calculate the cost based on that range’s cost.  

* **2_Auto_Insurance.py** - I'll write a program that computes monthly insurance according to a schedule.
