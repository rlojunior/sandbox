# About this folder
Develop a MariaDB database design that will be used by a dog breeder.

## The purpose of this project is:

>Design a database to track information on dogs and
>clients. The company has several male and female animals it uses for breeding puppies for sale to
>different clients. As the puppies are in high demand, each client may only purchase one puppy each year
>a new litter is produced.

>The information they keep on their dogs (parents and puppies) includes the name, breed, father and
>mother (if raised by breeder), gender (m/f/neuter), shots (yes/no), date of birth, and the status of the dog
>(in the kennel, ready for sale, has been sold, or has died). The information they keep on clients includes
>their name, complete address, phone number, a record of what dogs the client has purchased through this
>breeder, when the animal was purchased and the price the puppy was sold for.
