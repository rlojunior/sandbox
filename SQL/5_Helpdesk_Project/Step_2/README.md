## New requirements for this step 

Enhance my initial design by adding advanced database concepts:
a. Add appropriate check constraints to non-key fields with limited values.
b. Add appropriate unique constraints to non-key fields with unique values.
c. Add appropriate default constraints to non-key fields to simplify inserting records.
d. Add appropriate indexes to non-key fields used for searching records.
e. Update your design documents to include the changes.
f. Highlight the changes by including a document that details only the changes and
...references the design documents appropriately.
