## Requirements for this step 

1. The database must hold information about the users and the support staff.
2. Both users and support staff can generate new tickets.
3. Tickets must at least contain information about who generated the ticket,
...what category the ticket is under (e.g. software installation, hardware issue,
...etc), and who is currently assigned to work on the ticket.
4. If the ticket is for a hardware issue, the ticket will also contain information
...about the hardware, so any warranty repairs can be dealt with.
5. Once the ticket has been submitted, a support staff member will then be
...assigned to handle the ticket.
6. The staff member may request additional information from the user for
...clarification around the issue and this will be communicated via a comment
...thread in the ticket that the user can then respond to.
7. The ticket may also generate different tasks that need to be tracked as well.
...For example, new equipment may need to be ordered, installed or
...configured.
